** Client-Side Computes
- implement event loop for computes+render
- forward state
- display state in HTML canvas
  (stay general -> eventual switching to server-side computes)
** Server-Side Computes
- byte-stream conversion on server
  + convert state to bytes
- server-client communication via TCP
  + implement TCP listener on server
  + send byte-stream from server to client
  + implement periodic (+async?) get requests on client
  + receive byte-stream on client from server
- byte-stream conversion on client
  + convert state from bytes
- display systems/entities in renderer-client
- database access
  + save state to database
    - encode systems/entities
  + load state from database
    - decode systems/entities
